        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate computer programming student with a love for coding and problem-solving. When I'm not immersed in algorithms and debugging, you can find me on the football field, where I channel my competitive spirit and teamwork skills. Balancing the intricacies of code with the adrenaline of the game keeps me focused and driven in both realms.
